I can reach your URL ✅ — kin-2-workforce-kin2serviceslim.replit.app resolves and shows the page title “Kin2 Workforce – Enterprise Platform,” but the content isn’t rendering (likely a client-side error in the frontend bundle or a bad path to assets). 

Here’s a fast fix checklist (no back-and-forth needed):

1. If this is a React/Vite/Next SPA



Vite: set base: '/' in vite.config.ts.

React Router: ensure a catch-all so deep links work on refresh.

Next: if using static export, make sure it’s deployed as a static site or with a Node server.


2. Serve the SPA with a catch-all (Express example)



import express from "express";
import path from "path";
const app = express();
const __dirname = path.resolve();
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "dist")));
app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "dist", "index.html"));
});
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, "0.0.0.0", () => console.log(`Listening on ${port}`));

On Replit, always bind to 0.0.0.0 and process.env.PORT.


3. Check for busted asset paths



In index.html, ensure <base href="/"> (for SPAs).

Open browser console: if you see 404s for assets/*.js or chunk-*.js, paths are wrong or the build folder isn’t what the server expects.


4. If you have an API



Make sure the backend is actually running on the same deployment or that the frontend uses the correct API_URL.

On Replit, avoid hard-coding http://localhost:3000; use relative /api/... or an env var.


5. Environment variables on Replit



Add them in the Secrets panel and reference via process.env.X. For Vite, expose with VITE_ prefix.


6. Replit build/run commands



In the Replit “Deploy” config:

Build: npm run build

Run: node server.js (or whatever starts your Express server)


If you’re serving static only: use npx serve -s dist -l $PORT


Quick smoke test endpoints you can add:

app.get("/api/health", (_req, res) => res.json({ ok: true, ts: Date.now() }));

If you paste your current package.json scripts and (if applicable) vite.config.* or your server file names, I’ll pinpoint the exact line to change.
